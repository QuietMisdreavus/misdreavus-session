*misdreavus-session.txt* Session management plugin

misdreavus-session - A barebones session management plugin

INTRODUCTION				*misdreavus-session*

This plugin provides a simple wrapper around the built-in |:mksession|
command, as well as facilities to automatically save and load session files
from the current directory.


==================================================================
OPTIONS					*misdreavus-session-options*

By default, misdreavus-session does not perform any additional behavior over
what is already built-in to Vim. However, some additional functionality is
available by setting some options before the plugin is loaded.


g:misdreavus_session_autosave		*g:misdreavus_session_autosave*

This setting controls the auto-save behavior when Vim is exited. When this
setting is configured, misdreavus-session will automatically save the current
state of Vim into a session when it is closed. This will only occur when a
session has already been loaded or saved (i.e. |v:this_session| has the path
to the session file).

There are three possible values:

- `'no'` (default) - Do not auto-save.
- `'yes'`          - If a session file was loaded, automatically save to it on
                   exit.
- `'prompt'`       - Like `'yes'`, but prompt on exit if a session was not
                   just saved.


g:misdreavus_session_autoload		*g:misdreavus_session_autoload*

This setting controls the auto-load behavior when Vim is opened. When this
setting is configured, misdreavus-session will look for a session file in the
current directory (with a name configured by |g:misdreavus_session_default|)
and load it after all the startup plugins have been loaded. This will only
occur when no argument list is given, and no session file is given on the
command-line with |-S|.

There are three possible values:

- `'no'` (default) - Do not auto-load.
- `'yes'`          - If a session file is available, automatically load it on
                   startup.
- `'prompt'`       - Like `'yes'`, but prompt on startup if a session is
                   available.


g:misdreavus_session_default		*g:misdreavus_session_default*

This setting controls the default filename used for |:SaveSession|,
|:LoadSession| and |g:misdreavus_session_autoload|. The default value is
`'Session.vim'` (the default for |:mksession|).


==================================================================
COMMANDS				*misdreavus-session-commands*

:SaveSession [filename]			*:SaveSession*
		Save the current session to the given [filename]. If no name
		is given, the value of |g:misdreavus_session_default| is used.

		the value of |g:misdreavus_session_default| is used.

		See |:quit| for the behavior with or without the [!].


==================================================================
FUNCTIONS				*misdreavus-session-functions*

MisdreavusSessionStatus()		*MisdreavusSessionStatus()*
		Returns 1 if a session has just been saved with
		|:SaveSession|, or 0 if a change has happened since the last
		save. Can be used to display whether the session is "dirty"
		with respect to the file on disk.
